# StealthCup 2025: Evasion-Focused IDS Benchmarking

**StealthCup** is a novel evaluation framework that benchmarks Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) under **realistic, adversarial conditions**.  
Instead of replaying synthetic datasets, StealthCup uses **evasion-focused Capture-the-Flag (CTF)** challenges executed by professional penetration testers on a validated IT/OT testbed.  

The project combines:
- Realistic, multi-stage attack chains (IT ‚Üí OT pivoting, AD takeover, PLC manipulation).
- A fully automated, reproducible **Infrastructure-as-Code** setup (Terraform, Ansible, Packer).
- Comparative evaluation of open-source (Snort, Suricata, Wazuh) and commercial IDS solutions.
- Open datasets of alerts, PCAPs, logs, and structured attacker writeups.  

StealthCup complements traditional benchmarks by exposing **where IDS configurations fail against stealthy adversaries**.
